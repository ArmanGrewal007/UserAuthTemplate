# Simple template for rails 7 - User Authentication

To run this, first you must have ruby installed in your system (ruby 2.6 comes pre-installed in Macs, but it is deprecated so
we need to install a new version)
<br> <br> <br>
### Steps to install Ruby and Rails
First install rbenv
```terminal
brew install rbenv
```
Add this line to .zshrc, to ensure rbenv is properly intialized when you open a new session 
```terminal
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' > ~/.zshrc
```
Show list of available ruby versions
```terminal
rbenv install -l
```
Install version of your choice, we are using **3.1.2**
```terminal
rbenv install 3.1.2
```
Set global version
```terminal
rbenv global 3.1.2
```
Install bundler gem (for handling gemfiles)
```terminal
sudo gem install bundler --no-document
```
Install rails gem (we are using **7.0.5**)
```terminal
sudo gem install rails --no-document
```
